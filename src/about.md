## About

### 🏀 Kass
My background is in education and multimedia. Topics that I geek out about are: basketball, design, and baby Yoda. During the week I develop multimedia and e-learning materials for post-secondary, and in my free time I watch the Raptors, volunteer with youth, and try to master the art of dip-dyeing socks. I am currently exploring the world of XR and learning about XR development via NEWVIEW School Toronto.
