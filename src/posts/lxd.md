This elearning project involved the creation of learner personas, the development of a custom HTML template, and the incorporation of interactive course components throughout each module. All components are web accessible and WCAG compliant, and Universal Design for Learning best practices have been woven throughout the course. This offering is available through Brightspace and was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

This workshop content has a clear learning goal, example projects, and challenges early on in the learning experience. It has a scaffolded structure, where learners are provided with key information and walk through an exercise together, then provided with clear instructions and resources to work through steps on their own or with a partner.

Through feedback surveys and focus groups, we learned that the two elements that matter most to teens are choice and the opportunity to socialize. The main project is intentionally customizable, while ensuring learners meet all objectives of the workshop. Learners have the ability to collaborate within Glitch (the tool we are using) and encouraged to ask questions throughout or during a built-in Q&A portion.

This is an unplugged (no-tech) lesson plan for educators to leverage in their classroom in order to teach Computer Science concepts in a cross-curricular way.  

Through our educator journey mapping and feedback surveys, educators have expressed that they want short and simple lessons, with low-to-no tech. Elements that are most important to them are clear assessment and content that is mapped to their curriculum. This lesson plan includes assessment and extension ideas, and is mapped to curriculum across Canada (under "Curricular Connections").

This workshop content was developed for our National Ladies Learning Code Day. It was designed for mid-career adults looking to up-skill, as well as entrepreneurs interested in creating an online presence for their business. 

Canada Learning Code aims to support learners who are most underserved with computer science learning opportunities, specifically Black, Indigenous and People of Colour learners, and women, trans & beyond binary learners. In order to tailor content and experiences to the unique needs of these communities, it was essential to involve Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from within these groups. 

This content is also largely shaped by andragogy - for example, having learners document or share what they desire to gain from the experience (WIIFM), as adult learners are most often intrinsically motivated.

The learning experience includes many opportunities to reflect on and apply concepts, as well as discuss ideas with other learners. It was important to build in this time as adults learn best from their own and others' experiences. The content also features a concrete example of an entrepreneur and her application of concepts to demonstrate the relevancy and applicability of the learning objectives.

Instructor resources include the primary learning goal and objectives, key concepts and tools, timing, a preparatory checklist, and modification and extension ideas to ensure that the learning experience is inclusive to all ability levels and learning preferences.
