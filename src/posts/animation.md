## Video

### Instructor Training Series

A colleague and I translated our lengthy Instructor Training Guide into a series of ten, 2-3 minute videos to ensure training for our volunteer instructors was an engaging and less time-intensive experience. 

We scripted, storyboarded, and filmed with our mighty team of two. I then edited in titles, intro music, mini animations and sound effects to create a playful tone. Prepare yourself for some ðŸ§€-y yet informative videos!

### Walking Cycle

Walking cycle for another animation project. The girl was traced in illustrator from a still from a video taken of my cousin.  I layered the body parts separately and then animated them in After Effects.
